# Wave-Propagation
The program is coded in C++ and used Raylib for visualization.
This algorithm is called "Wave Propagation" which is a pathfinding algorithm that checks all the cells in the grid and assigns a distance from the target to the starting point, to then be able to find the shortest route. 
Use the Left Mouse Button to create obstacles and Right Mouse Button to change the starting point. Also use Left Mouse Button with Left_Shift to change the end point.
I have made it so that the algorithm searches in a 4 path way looking at the North/East/West/South or also take a 8 path way that would look in between all the 4 directions.
